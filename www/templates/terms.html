      <ol>
          <li>
                The App is designed to provide You an in-app browsing experience through an embedded browser. The App does not per se provide any news or content or information; but provides a brief summary of the content available in public domain within 60 (sixty) words or less by aggregating such content within one platform for easy access by You and for assisting You to find corresponding content of Your interest. The App does not host, display or transmit any content owned by third parties on its servers, unless We either have a license or are not prohibited under the applicable law, to do the same. When You read a summary, You may be linked to one of the online sources of such duly aggregated summary, upon tapping “More” tab on Your screen. You agree and acknowledge that the App does not report and/or broadcast any content (including news) on its own accord and R&D Apps is not responsible or liable for the content or accuracy of the summary of content that may be accessed by You through the App.
          </li>
<li>
        The App may include links to other mobile applications and/or websites (some of which may be automated search results) which may contain materials that are objectionable, unlawful, or inaccurate. We do not endorse or support these links or the products and services they provide; these links are provided for Your convenience only. We are not responsible or liable for the content or accuracy of such links.
