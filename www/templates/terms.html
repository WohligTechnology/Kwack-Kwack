      <h4 class="terms-subheading">C. PROVISION OF THE APP</h4>
      <ol>
          <li>
                The App is designed to provide You an in-app browsing experience through an embedded browser. The App does not per se provide any news or content or information; but provides a brief summary of the content available in public domain within 60 (sixty) words or less by aggregating such content within one platform for easy access by You and for assisting You to find corresponding content of Your interest. The App does not host, display or transmit any content owned by third parties on its servers, unless We either have a license or are not prohibited under the applicable law, to do the same. When You read a summary, You may be linked to one of the online sources of such duly aggregated summary, upon tapping “More” tab on Your screen. You agree and acknowledge that the App does not report and/or broadcast any content (including news) on its own accord and R&D Apps is not responsible or liable for the content or accuracy of the summary of content that may be accessed by You through the App.
          </li>
<li>
        The App may include links to other mobile applications and/or websites (some of which may be automated search results) which may contain materials that are objectionable, unlawful, or inaccurate. We do not endorse or support these links or the products and services they provide; these links are provided for Your convenience only. We are not responsible or liable for the content or accuracy of such links.

</li>
<li>In order to provide the App to You, We may request You to register and/or provide information about yourself. We trust that any information provided by You will always be true, accurate, complete and updated.
    </li>
<li>The content displayed on the App is for Your non-commercial and personal use. You are not allowed to copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works of, or publicly display any content displayed on the App.
    </li>
<li>We may stop provision of the App (or any part of the App), permanently or temporarily, to You or to Users generally or may modify or change the nature of the App and/or these Terms at Our sole discretion, without any prior notice to You. Your use of the App following any such modification constitutes Your deemed acceptance to be bound by the Agreement (or as it may be modified).
    </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 class="terms-subheading">D. YOUR AGREEMENT WITH R&D Apps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>A violation of this Agreement may result in a legal liability upon You and that nothing in this Agreement should be construed to confer any rights to any third party. You are responsible for Your conduct and activities while using the App, and for any consequences thereof.</li>
            <li> If any provision of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable under the applicable law, it will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.
                </li>
            <li>We may choose to not act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by You or others but this does not mean that We cannot act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Our intended or intended failure to exercise or enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li>
